# Task 4 – ADVANCED ENCRYPTION TOOL

## 🔐 Project Description
This is a Python-based encryption tool that uses AES-256 (via the cryptography library) to secure and recover files.  
It includes a menu-driven interface to:
- Generate an encryption key
- Encrypt files (any type)
- Decrypt previously encrypted files
